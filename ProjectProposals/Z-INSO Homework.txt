Project Proposal:
	GPS service cross-checker and internet scraper to see if certain lanes are closed or not
	(can also be applied to traffic).
Problem Statement:
	GPS services, though reliable, sometimes do not provide accurate data on the status of a road and
	therefore formulate routes that may not be idealif roads thought to be closed are open,
	or the opposite where it sends you through a route that has a primary road closed or with heavy traffic.
Target Users
	Everyday commuters are targeted, but suppliers and truckers can also greatly benefit from such a system.
Cost of Delay
	If the system is not implemented, GPS users will have to guess if a GPS route is the best or not
	depending on closed lanes/heavy traffic, which the GPS app may not have current info on.
Constraints
	Some possible constraints could be that the internet might not be the best place to ascertain the status
	of roads or that there may not be good online resources at all, which would limit the system to only
	comparing different GPS services.
New User Experience
	If working for, say, Google Maps, a separate panel or indicator may say whether a lane is closed
	or not depending on recent news, reportings, or transit metrics.
Validation and Measurement Plan
	Validating the system would involve talking to average people and seeing if they would like such a system.
	Measuring the correctness of the system would involve possibly lengthy tests where real traffic scenarios
	would be observed and comparing the system's output to the real situation.
